# 6th-Planet
 This is a more improved version of my first planet pack  It's a small but decent pack. It adds:  -Yela: A cold yellow gas giant. Its existence was unknown for a long time, but scientists managed to find it.  -Ucko: A small asteroid moon in low orbit around Yela, it has a small sphere of influence making it sometimes hard to get an encounter.  -Ela: An icy world covered with endless sheets of ice and a thin atmosphere. The view is rather beautiful when on the correct side.  -Molee: The outermost moon. Its surface is covered with large impact craters, making for some interesting hills.
